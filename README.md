# Two Column Text Editor #
A single module which provides two WYSIWYG editors, allowing for side-by-side content panels within a single page builder column.

### Overview ###
Beaver Builder is a fantastic plugin, but there is currently no ability to nest row layouts (perhaps for good reason). Sometimes, however, you may need to create side-by-side panels of content that can fit within a single page builder column (e.g. when you're using the "Left Sidebar" or "Right Sidebar" row layouts, but need a portion of your main content to be divided into two side-by-side columns). This module gives you that basic ability.

### How Does This Module Work? ###
This module works just like the built-in Text Editor module from the "Basic Modules" section of the page builder, except that it offers two separate WYSIWYG editors (instead of one). Each editor controls a separate panel of content which will appear side-by-side the other. There is also a setting to control the spacing between the internal panels/columns.

### Dependencies & Compatibility ###
This module is dependent on the [Beaver Builder plugin](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com) for Wordpress.

This module is also intended for use with the [Beaver Brewer Wordpress plugin](http://beaverbrewer.com).

### Installation ###
DO NOT place this module inside your wp-content/plugins folder; that won't do anything. Instead, download the module ZIP file and upload it straight to your site using the Beaver Brewer admin page (or, if you'd prefer to do things manually, extract the contents of the ZIP into wp-content/bb-modules). You will then need to activate the module through the Beaver Brewer admin.
