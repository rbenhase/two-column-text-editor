<h1 id="twocolumntexteditor">Two Column Text Editor</h1>

<p>A single module which provides two WYSIWYG editors, allowing for side-by-side content panels within a single page builder column.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Beaver Builder is a fantastic plugin, but there is currently no ability to nest row layouts (perhaps for good reason). Sometimes, however, you may need to create side-by-side panels of content that can fit within a single page builder column (e.g. when you&#8217;re using the &#8220;Left Sidebar&#8221; or &#8220;Right Sidebar&#8221; row layouts, but need a portion of your main content to be divided into two side-by-side columns). This module gives you that basic ability.</p>

<h3 id="howdoesthismodulework">How Does This Module Work?</h3>

<p>This module works just like the built-in Text Editor module from the &#8220;Basic Modules&#8221; section of the page builder, except that it offers two separate WYSIWYG editors (instead of one). Each editor controls a separate panel of content which will appear side-by-side the other. There is also a setting to control the spacing between the internal panels/columns.</p>

<h3 id="dependenciescompatibility">Dependencies &amp; Compatibility</h3>

<p>This module is dependent on the <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com">Beaver Builder plugin</a> for Wordpress.</p>

<p>This module is also intended for use with the <a href="http://beaverbrewer.com">Beaver Brewer Wordpress plugin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>DO NOT place this module inside your wp-content/plugins folder; that won&#8217;t do anything. Instead, download the module ZIP file and upload it straight to your site using the Beaver Brewer admin page (or, if you&#8217;d prefer to do things manually, extract the contents of the ZIP into wp-content/bb-modules). You will then need to activate the module through the Beaver Brewer admin.</p>
